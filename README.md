## Introduction 

Sentiment analysis of movie reviews has become an essential task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with applications ranging from recommendation systems to consumer insight analysis. In this project, we explore the automatic classification of movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments using supervised machine learning models.

---

## Aim

The goal is to compare the performance of several well-established algorithms—including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—using a standard movie review dataset from Stanford. Each model is trained on TF-IDF representations of the reviews and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Through careful preprocessing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning, this project demonstrates how traditional models can still offer strong performance for text classification tasks—particularly when combined with effective representation techniques.
